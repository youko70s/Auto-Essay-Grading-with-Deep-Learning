# Auto Essay Grader Using Deep Learning

An auto essay grading system using neural network. In this project, we compare basic neural network, LSTM, and LSTM using pretrained model (GloVe).

## Environment

All scripts are tested on Google Colab and could be run perfectly. It is not recommended to run locally considering the size of the datasets.

## Files

In this project, we have already provided the results in the `590_poster.pdf` and `project_writeup.pdf`. In the report, we generally introduced the data we used, the problems we researched, and the methods we used. We also procided information on the models and the pretrained models in our case.

The core codes could be found on all `.ipynb` files.
